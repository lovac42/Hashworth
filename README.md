## Hashworth: Field Duplicate Finder

## About:
This addon generates a hash value (MD5) for the selected field. This checksum will be added to the note's tag and any duplicated question can be filtered using these tags. Though the process is not perfect.



## Tag Management:
You may also need these additional addons in order to manage the tags:
