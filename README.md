## Hashworth: Field Duplicate Finder

## About:
This addon generates a hash value (MD5) for the selected field. Each field is processed and stripped of punctuation, pronouns, whitespace, etc... The checksum is used to search for duplicates in other notes/models that may have a different structure.

So, to illustrate:  
```"My ball.", "my balls!", "your ball?", "Your balls...", "Johny's Ball"```  
Except for the last one, the first four are all duplicates after processing.


## Tag Management:
